sql notes;

>> sql server 2008 R2 is being used. 

>> microsoft sql server management studio is being used to explore the databases. pubs database has been downloaded and loaded. it has tables like authors, 
publishers, titles. 

>> collection of realted data is known as database. DMBS is the software which creates, maintains and deletes the databases etc. Table has the realted data. 
schema is set of rules, which the table has to be followed. it determines how the data to be stored, related etc. 
>> columns, rows, datatypes

>> USE, SELECT, FROM.  
USE db_name
SELECT col_name1, col_name2 etc
FROM table_name

>> ORDER BY col_name --> to sort alphabetically in ascending order by column_name.

>> WHERE --> to specify a condition. single quotes used to deleanate a string. '=' is used. It is used to retrieve only those records which meets certain criterion.
WHERE col_name = 'val';
WHERE clause has comes with various operators. '=' is one such operator. =, != or <>, <,<=,>, >=, BETWEEN, AND, OR, NOT, IS NULL, LIKE, IN

>> wild cards. * matches everything of column names
% matches any number of characters occuring any number of times.
_ represents single character. 

>> AND, OR can be used in WHERE clause where we want to specify more than one condition.

>>LIKE operaror. this operator has been used in the WHERE clause. this LIKE operator can be used along with the AND OR NOT etc operators too.

>> IN operator. 
WHERE col_name IN (val1,val2,val3,etc)

CHAR vs VARCHAR: You can always use CHAR when you have fixed length data type such as zip code, state abbrevation or a phone number. CHAR wil always allocates the maximum length of characters irrespective of wether they are used or not. VARCHAR will allocates just enough memory to hold the datatype.

NULL value: This indicates that no data has been entered. 

*****************************************************************
>> Aliases:
it is just another name for the column. it is used to enhance the readability. usecases are when creating a column out of a calculation, or when querying multiple tables. 

col_name AS "alias name"

>> Calculating data:
column can be created on the fly by making a calculation and using alias "AS".
>> Count Function: to get the total number of records, use this query. SELECT COUNT (*), FROM db_name;

>> Distinct: to pull out unique records. 
>> Aggregate functions. COUNT, AVG, SUM, MIN, MAX

>> Converting Datatypes: the data that was there in the column is not suitable for the calculation that you intend to perform, we use datatype conversion. 
CAST and CONVERT are two functions availble.

>> GROUP BY operates based on the aggragate functions like count, avg,min,max etc. The column name specified in the SELECT statment must appear in the GROUP BY clause.

>> HAVING Clause: this HAVING clause is being used with the GROUP BY clause as a filter.
